# Data Structures and Algorithms

Programming assignments
for [Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

## About the specialization

This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various
computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your
choice.

The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road
networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000
times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from
millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.
